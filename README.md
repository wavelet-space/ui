## Goals

For web projects, we often need the default appearance of documents.
Deployment for administration or demonstration pages (dashboard) is ideal.
The goal is to create a basic set of styles in the form of a small CSS framework that can be used as a reasonable basis and that can be easily adapted to a specific project.
